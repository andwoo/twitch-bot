# twitch-bot
Twitch Bot was created to scan the Twitch chat of a streamer. While watching a tournament, I was curious as to how many times some keywords were said. I quickly wrote up this bot using the [tmi.js](https://www.tmijs.org/) library to read the stream's chat room. I then proceeded to check how many times people were mentioning Team A and Team B, using regex, to see who people preferred. 

# TODO
- Clean up code.
- Track some form of analytics and display in a real time graph.
